# Craftfolio

**Craftfolio** is a backend API project built in **Go (Golang)** with **PostgreSQL** and deployed to **AWS**.  
It is designed as a **developer portfolio application**, where users can be created, managed, and queried through a clean and scalable CRUD architecture.

This project demonstrates:

- Building production-ready backend services without frameworks (pure Go).
- Using PostgreSQL as the relational database for managing user records.
- Dockerized development and testing setup.
- Deployment to AWS with cloud-native best practices.

The application is intended to showcase backend engineering skills for **real-world user management systems**, where “users” represent generic application users (not students, admins, etc.—but the foundation can be extended to those roles).

# Go + Postgres + AWS Developer Portfolio

## Objective

This repository documents the development of **Craftfolio**, a real-world user management API and developer portfolio project. The goal is to demonstrate mastery of backend development with **Go (Golang)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS** while following a 20-week roadmap.

Over the course of 20 weeks, Craftfolio will be built step by step, applying clean code principles, real-world API design, and strong foundations in system design and algorithms.

The roadmap includes:

- Building backend APIs in Go with PostgreSQL as the database.
- Deploying services to AWS using industry best practices.
- Applying concurrency, design patterns, and cloud-native principles.
- Practicing algorithms.
- Maintaining public GitHub projects as proof of skills.

**Tracking:**  
Daily progress will be logged with commits, a `PLAN.md` file for the roadmap, and check-ins in a private journal.

## Milestones

- **Week 1–2:** Build the foundation of Craftfolio — a Go API with PostgreSQL for user management. Containerize with Docker for local development.
- **Week 3–8:** Enhance Craftfolio with concurrency patterns, clean architecture, and advanced PostgreSQL features (indexes, transactions).
- **Week 9–12:** Deploy Craftfolio to AWS (ECS/Fargate, RDS, API Gateway). Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Week 13–18:** Extend Craftfolio with scalability features, apply system design principles, and refine backend performance. Practice algorithms alongside.
- **Week 19–20:** Finalize Craftfolio as a polished portfolio project, add documentation, and prepare it for showcasing in interviews.
