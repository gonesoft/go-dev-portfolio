# go-dev-portfolio

How to effectively regain proficiency in Go development after an extended break, with a focus on sharpening logical thinking and re-engaging with the Go ecosystem.

# Go + Postgres + AWS Developer Portfolio

## Objective

This repository documents my journey to **become a highly skilled backend developer** specializing in **Go (Golang)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **AWS**.

Over the course of 20 weeks, I will build real-world projects, practice clean code principles, and develop strong foundations in system design and algorithms.

The roadmap includes:

- Building backend APIs in Go with PostgreSQL as the database.
- Deploying services to AWS using industry best practices.
- Applying concurrency, design patterns, and cloud-native principles.
- Practicing algorithms.
- Maintaining public GitHub projects as proof of skills.

**Tracking:**  
Daily progress will be logged with commits, a `PLAN.md` file for the roadmap, and check-ins in a private journal.
